Edited go() method to call refuel() when fuel level dips below ten percent, rather than to exactly zero

Passenger.java
Modified getOnCar(Car c) to be called boardCar(Car c)

Train.java
Removed attribute maxCapacity, as it was redundant
Modified getMaxCapacity() to utilize the Car method getCapacity() instead of the deleted attribute
