# Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment

- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I am so relieved that I've made association make sense in my brain. Classes that made use of other classes was something I struggled with a lot on the first python coding assignment and it didn't really click until I was working on this assignment earlier & wasn't able to make use of a method from the Car class in the Passenger class because I hadn't saved the Car class yet. Not sure why that tipped my understanding, but it did. I like using association like this quite a lot. I find it very satisfying to be able to break things into smaller parts, like different classes, and it neatens up my programming a lot.

What worked: The order I did things made it VERY easy to complete a lot of it. I followed the guidelines in the instructions but created simple, base methods without very complicated things in them & then went back to build up the functionality once everything was in place.

What didn't: I had a very difficult time figuring out Exceptions (and I mostly understand what we've covered so far in concept, the practice still needs some work before I'm super confident in the execution).
